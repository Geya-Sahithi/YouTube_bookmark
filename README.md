II) The Play button▶️ on the bookmark button has the functionality of playing the video in the specified timestamp.
III) The delete button ❌ deletes the bookmark on that particular timestamp.
IV) The bookmarks are not erased(if they are not erased manually with the delete button) when the YouTube page is changed into another. 
When a previously bookmarked page is revised the bookmarks are retrived and not lost.
